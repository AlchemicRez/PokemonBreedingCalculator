# PokemonBreedingCalculator
Simulate the outcome of breeding pokemon who are holding the Destiny Knot

## What is this thing?
This application allows the user to specify Pokemon IVs for two parents (one of which is holding the Destiny Knot) and generate the IVs of a resulting child.  This can be done as many times as desired and the results can be pasted into excel / google docs for analysis.

Basically it helps you determine the odds of breeding specific IVs.

## Features
* Easily generate hundreds of simulated uh... poke-children
* Highlights perfect IVs
* Options to quickly maximize, manually set, or randomize parent IVs
* Toggle between CSV or TAB separated outputs
* Includes the parent IVs and headers in the output each time parent IVs change.
* Uses a fancy GUI!!!
* Not written using AI - I can write bad code all by myself.
* No animals were harmed during the construction of this software, but a whole lot of electrons were inconvenienced.
